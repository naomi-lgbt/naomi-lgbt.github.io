        It has been a long journey, but you have finally arrived at Avalon, the
        city that Naomi built. Feeling relieved, you reach into your pack and pull
        out a map of the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, your map isn't very detailed. You aren't quite sure where
        you should head.
      </p>

        Thankfully, there appears to be a central area in the middle of the city.
        You can hear some activity coming from that direction. It must be some
        sort of plaza - surely you could get better directions there!
