      As you walk in to this hall of knowledge, your eyes readjust to the dim
      candle light. The first thing you notice is just how quiet it is. Which
      makes sense, libraries are always quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the entrance is a large desk. A polite but quiet woman sits there. As
      she notices you, she waves you over. When you approach the desk, she
      speaks to you.

      <p>Hello there! Was there a specific book you were looking for?</p>
    </div>
    <p>Which book would you like to ask about?</p>

  <div *ngIf="openBook" class="nes-container with-title is-centered is-rounded">
    <h1 class="title">{{ openBook.title }}</h1>
    <p>
      The librarian hands you the book you asked for. You slowly open it,
      turning through the pages.
    </p>
    <div class="nes-container with-title is-centered is-dark is-rounded">
      <p *ngFor="let line of openBook.text">{{ line }}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Closing the book, you hand it back to the librarian, who smiles at you.
