      As you walk in to this hall of knowledge, your eyes readjust to the dim
      candle light. The first thing you notice is just how quiet it is. Which
      makes sense, libraries are always quiet.

      Near the entrance is a large desk. Melody walks over to it and motions for
      you to join her.

      <p>Now then, which book may I fetch for you?</p>

    <p>Which book would you like to ask about?</p>

      Melody hands you the book you asked for. You slowly open it, turning
      through the pages.

    <p>Closing the book, you hand it back to Melody, who smiles at you.</p>
