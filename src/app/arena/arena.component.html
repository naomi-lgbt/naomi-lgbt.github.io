    <p>
      As you enter, you can hear the sounds of steel clashing on steel. While
      you can't see it, you recognise the noise of active combat. A young woman
      clad in golden armour walks up to you.
    </p>

      <p>Who are you?</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      You explain to her that you are a visitor, having come to Avalon to learn
      more about Naomi.
    </p>
    <div
      class="nes-container with-title is-centered is-dark is-rounded dialogue"

        alt="arena master's face"
      />
      <p>
        This is a good place to be, then. Naomi might be fighting, or you can
        see her hall of fame. Or did you want to enter a fight yourself?

    <h1 class="title">Arena</h1>
    <p>
      You ask about the Hall of Fame, and the arena master takes you there. In
      front of you is a large stone wall with a bunch of text etched into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking closer, you can see it is a list of Naomi's most famous fights.

      The arena master checks the current schedule of matches, and shows you the
      current fight.
    </p>
    <img

      src="https://rpc.naomi.lgbt"

    <p *ngIf="!activities.length">
      She then explains that there haven't been any recent fights to show you.
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="activities.length">
      She also hands you a list of the recent fights.
    </p>
    <div
      *ngFor="let activity of activities"

      <p>{{ activity.description }}</p>
      <p>Match Occurred: {{ activity.date }}</p>
    </div>
    <p>Finally, she asks if there was anything else you needed.</p>
  </div>
  <div
    *ngIf="view === 'fight'"
    class="nes-container with-title is-centered is-rounded"
  >
    <h1 class="title">Arena</h1>
    <p>
      You ask the arena master if there is a way for you to participate in the
      fighting too.
    </p>
    <div
      class="nes-container with-title is-centered is-dark is-rounded dialogue"

      <p>
        Now that's what I like to hear! We are always happy to welcome new
        fighters to the arena. Here's a list of fights you can sign up for.

    <p>She hands you a scroll containing a list of open fights.</p>
