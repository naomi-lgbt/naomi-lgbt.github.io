      'Naomi Carrigan is a software developer based in the United States.',
      'She primarily works in TypeScript, though she is willing to learn other languages if needed. For the front end, she uses Angular. For the back end, she uses Node.js with MongoDB and Express',
      'Most of her projects tend to be Discord bots, powered by discord.js, as that is an area which she finds engaging and challenging. And she is quite familiar with the Discord API.',
      'Aside from her dev work, Naomi enjoys playing a game or reading a book. Though she spends most of her time working, either as a developer or as a community manager.',
      'Naomi is quite passionate about community building, helping out in multiple communities while also maintaining her own.',
      'She can also be seen playing Dungeons and Dragons or Magic: The Gathering on occasion.',

      "Naomi's early life was one of discovery and exploration. Her early education was spent at an art school, where she discovered a passion for music. By graduation, she had learned to play the clarinet, piano, bassoon, and saxophone - though she retains very few of those skills today.",
      'After graduation, Naomi acquired a job at her local grocery retailer, hoping to earn some money as she continued her education in university.',
      'Her original passion was to become a teacher, which is what she first pursued in her higher education. The programme she wanted to get in to, hwever, was highly selective, and she did not make the cut.',
      'Still working her grocery job, Naomi had become involved in the labour union there. Finding this to be another interest, she decided to start taking classes on labour law. This went well for her, and she enjoyed the studies, but the university she was attending had shut down in the middle of her learning.',
      'Finding herself lost once again, she enrolled in a third university. This time she resumed her teaching education, while also taking some pre-medical classes (not at all because she loved the show House, M.D.). Ultimately, life ended up taking her in a different direction and she withdrew from her education before completing any degree programme.',
      'Naomi spent a few years throwing herself into her grocery retail career, having found herself in a position where collegiate studies were no longer appealing. During this time, she advanced to a service manager position, where she was responsible for managing the customer service standards and expectations for the entire store. She also took on additional responsibilities, such as handling the scheduling, and hiring new associates.',

      'In April of 2020, Naomi found herself in a position where she would resign from her retail work. In the midst of the pandemic, she was now unemployed - but in a good financial position where she could take some time off.',
      'Her plan was originally to take a few months off to do nothing but lounge around, game, and explore her own interests. That... lasted all of two weeks before she was completely bored out of her mind.',
      'In need of a new hobby (and having always loved computers, electronics, and technology), Naomi decided she would explore the idea of learning to code. She searched up "learn to code for free" and came across freeCodeCamp, where she signed up and started the curriculum.',
      'While this was just intended to be a hobby, and Naomi was considering a career in human resources, she ended up diving in full force. Within about 6 months she had completed the entire freeCodeCamp curriculum (at least, what was there at the time). Finding a strong love for this work, she continued to branch out.',
      'freeCodeCamp had taught her the basics of the MERN stack, but a fellow developer in the community had introduced her to TypeScript and Angular. She fell in love, and now uses TypeScript on all of her projects.',
      'Naomi became highly involved in open source, contributing to other projects and starting her own projects. Included in those contributions, of course, was the freeCodeCamp code base. After a few months of steady and quality contribution, she was given the chance to join the freeCodeCamp team in December of 2020. She has remained there ever since.',
