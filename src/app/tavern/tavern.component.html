    <h1 class="title">Tavern</h1>
    <p>
      The smell of alcohol hits your nose instantly as you open the door to the
      tavern. Looking around, the place is packed with tables, and each seems to
      be occupied by multiple adventurers already.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the tavern seems to be the bar area. Melody heads over to
      the bar and begins polishing some glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      You approach the bar and ask about the full tables, hoping for a place to
      sit and rest your weary legs.

        This is a social tavern. You are welcome to sit wherever you like - your
        fellow adventurers are quite friendly and happy to chat. And Naomi
        herself might even drop by!
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      She explains that some tables are more popular than others, and that she
      can give you a recommendation or show you the full list.

        The Discord table is a great place to chat with other adventurers about
        Naomi's fights, your own work, or even other interests such as gaming.

        The GitHub table is where you should go if you specifically want to work
        with other fighters.

        The Twitter table is the place where Naomi will share quick updates
        about her life.

        The Steam table is all about gaming, and you might be able to play with
        Naomi!

    <h1>Tavern</h1>
    <p>
      You politely request the full list of available tables. Melody points
      toward a poster hung in the back corner of the tavern. She also hands you
      a small lens.
    </p>
    <div
      class="nes-container with-title is-centered is-dark is-rounded dialogue"

    alt="A woman with teal-green hair pulled up in a tight bun, her left eye green and her right eye cyan, wearing a grey suit with a blue bow."
  />
      <p>
        You'll want to use this lens to validate that no one has tampered with
        the poster. It hasn't happened yet, but just in case...
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      You approach the poster and see that it is rather long. It would seem
      there are a lot of options available for seating!
    </p>
    <p>Are you sure you want to read all this?</p>
