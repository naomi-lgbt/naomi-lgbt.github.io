      Entering the museum, you notice it is quite large and seems to be filled
      with art. On closer examination, all of that art seems to be of Naomi.

    <p>A young woman greets you at the door, smiling warmly.</p>

    <p>You nod politely, wondering what exactly this place has to offer.</p>

        popular, but we also have a special "Emotion" exhibit.

      She leads you to a hall filled with paintings, each one a detailed and
      loving rendition of Naomi. You spend some time browsing the works.

      There are <strong>{{ portraits.length }}</strong> portraits available to

      She leads you into a room off to the side, almost as if this exhibit was
      an after-thought.

      You see smaller sculptures of Naomi making various expressions. You now
      understand the reason for this exhibit's name, at least.
