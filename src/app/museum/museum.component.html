      Entering the museum, you notice it is quite large and seems to be filled
      with art. On closer examination, all of that art seems to be of Naomi.

    <p>A young woman greets you at the door, smiling warmly.</p>

        Welcome to the Avalon Museum! Would you like to hear more about our
        exhibits?
      </p>

    <p>You nod politely, wondering what exactly this place has to offer.</p>

        We currently have two exhibits. Our portrait exhibit is the most
        popular, but we also have a special "Emotion" exhibit.

    <p>Which exhibit would you like to see?</p>

      She leads you to a hall filled with paintings, each one a detailed and
      loving rendition of Naomi. You spend some time browsing the works.

      She leads you into a room off to the side, almost as if this exhibit was
      an after-thought. As you enter, the first thing that catches your eye is a
      statue of Naomi.
    </p>
    <p>
      This statue, interestingly enough, appears to be moving. It would seem
      that there is magic at work here.

      <img id="model" src="/assets/img/model.gif" alt="My VTuber model" />
    </a>
    <p>
      Beyond the statue, you see smaller sculptures of Naomi making various
      expressions. You now understand the reason for this exhibit's name, at
      least.
