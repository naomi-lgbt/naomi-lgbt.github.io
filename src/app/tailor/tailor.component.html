      You find yourself in a strange tailor shoppe. Rather than an actual store,
      this appears to be meant to show off Naomi's outfits.

        Welcome to Naomi's wardrobe. You can see all of her outfits here, many
        of which I put together for her.

      Each outfit is carefully displayed on a stand, with a placard explaining
      the purpose of the clothing.

      There are <strong>{{ outfits.length }}</strong> outfits available to
      peruse.
