      You find yourself in a strange tailor shoppe. Rather than an actual store,
      this appears to be meant to show off Naomi's outfits. While there is no
      one here, you take the opportunity to look around a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each outfit is carefully displayed on a stand, with a placard explaining
      the purpose of the clothing.
