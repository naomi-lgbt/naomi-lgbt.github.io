      It has been a long journey, but you have finally arrived at Avalon, the
      city that Naomi built. Feeling relieved, you reach into your pack and pull
      out a map of the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, your map isn't very detailed. You aren't quite sure where
      you should head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully, there appears to be a central area in the middle of the city.
      You can hear some activity coming from that direction. It must be some
      sort of plaza - surely you could get better directions there!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way, you notice an interesting statue of Naomi. This statue appears
      to be moving. It would seem that there is magic at work here.
