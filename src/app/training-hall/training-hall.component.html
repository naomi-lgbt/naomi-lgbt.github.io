    <p>
      You decide to check out the training hall, where students can be seen
      sparring with each other in the front gardens. Walking past them all, you
      enter the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, you see instructors walking students through some drills. Swinging
      their weapons at straw dummies, every student is hard at work. One of the
      instructors turns to you.

    <p>You nod politely, interested to see how this all works.</p>

        Very good! The best training starts with reviewing past adventurers'
        success. In this case, we'll look at some of Naomi's travels.

      You follow the instructor into a small room. Scattered around the room are
      various scrolls, each depicting one of Naomi's adventures.

        Spend some time studying these. Learn from them. When your learning is
        sufficient, we can proceed.
